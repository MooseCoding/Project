          <h1>The boss of a nearby ranch has died</h1>
          <p>The boss of the ranch a few miles away has died from what surgeons suspect to be tuberculosis. This was figured to be caused from the constant exposure to new people as the boss of the ranch.</p>
          <p>His funeral was attended by his surviving son. That son also inherited the ranch. This caused many of the migrants working there to leave. Who knows what will happen to them next.</p>
