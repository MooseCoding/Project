          <h1>Breaking News Throughout Soledad</h1> 
          <!--Changing words below-->
          <h2>The last remaining member of the Soledad Four has died</h2>
          <p>George Milton was found dead by a river near our humble city. Docs suspected he killed himself but, there is little evidence of that. There is no other explanation they claim.</p>
          <p>The old ranch that George owned was auctioned off to a Mr. Chris.</P>
          <p>The Four all died in unique ways. Old Candy died of old age, that Crooks died of his back, Slim was killed in the skirmish, and George was killed by an unkown cause.</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <h1>A strange sighting was reported outside of the old ranch</h1>
          <p>Two strange men were seen walking around with a rabbit at their side. The rabbit was described as large and fluffy. The man on the left was tall and burley with a "small face". The other man was short and lean and "dark of face".</p>
          <p>No one has any clues about this. We are going to keep up with this story however.</p>
