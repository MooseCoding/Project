          <h1>The last remaining member of the Soledad Four has died</h1>
          <p>George Milton was found dead by a river near our humble city. Docs suspected he killed himself but, there is little evidence of that. There is no other explanation they claim.</p>
          <p>The old ranch that George owned was auctioned off to a Mr. Chris.</P>
          <p>The Four all died in unique ways. Old Candy died of old age, that Crooks died of his back, Slim was killed in the skirmish, and George was killed by an unkown cause.</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <h1>A strange sighting was reported outside of the old ranch</h1>
          <p>Two strange men were seen walking around with a rabbit at their side. The rabbit was described as large and fluffy. The man on the left was tall and burley with a "small face". The other man was short and lean and "dark of face".</p>
          <p>No one has any clues about this. We are going to keep up with this story however.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h1>A brief history lesson on the Soledad Four for those who needed it</h1>
          <p>The Soledad Four is the name for George Milton, Slim, Crooks, and Candy. These four men were being harrased by Curley on the Soledad ranch around 19-20 years back.</p>
          <p>Curley and Slim erupted at each other and grabbed pistols. A shooutout started and George grabbed his trusty Luger pistol. Candy and Crooks also played a key part by grabbing shotguns and manning posts around the top of the barn.</p>
          <p>As the shootout went on, some of the young men who were on the ranch came to Curley's aid and grabbed their guns and a grand firefight occured. Slim and his gang managed to kill Curley in the end though.</p>
          <p>That's your basic introduction to the Soledad Four for you uneducated folk.</p>
