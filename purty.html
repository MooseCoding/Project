          <p>All you did was make me go inside of our stupid house. All you ever did was yell at me for talking to other people. All you ever did was complain I was unfaithful.</p>
          <p>All you did was try too hard. All you ever did was try to fight. All you ever did was fill your ego to the brim. All you ever wanted of me was to be a toy for you.</p>
          <p>All you ever did was fail. All you ever will do is hurt.</p>
