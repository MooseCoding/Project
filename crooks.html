        <p>I grew up on my father's ranch and lived a relatively good life till I was about 12. The other kids would come over sometimes and play with me.</p>
        <p>Once I turned 12, I hurt my back, not like it was from the horse but still bad enough to give me a bad time for a few years.</p>
        <p>I turned 16 and pa said I got to go and make my own money. I complained and he relented and let me stay for two years.</p>
        <p>The people from my town on my 18th birthday drove us out of town, he was ran out of town and said, "Son please get outta here, I cannot provide for someone when I cannot provide for myself"</p>
        <p>I wandered from ranch to ranch. I worked up in Weed for a couple years and then made it to Soledad. Thought it was a decent job.</p>
        <p>Then I get crippled from a horse that was not letting me lead it out of the barn.</p>
        <p>Since, I now couldn't go do any games with the other guys, given I was crippled and black, so I started reading books.</p>
        <p>It drove me insane reading all those books, but I guess the boss was reading books and he owned the whole place.</p>
        <p>Then that big Lennie comes to my humble ranch. That was the first man who didn't care about my color. He wouldn't pay attention to me or anyone else but George.</p>
        <p>After the whole Curley's wife thing, the "shootout" happened.</p>
        <p>Nothing much, but the ranch that was a big deal.</p>
        <p>I spent all day cooking, hoeing, and cleaning but at least it was on my own land.</p>
        <p>It was sad when old Candy croaked, but I think it has to happen at some point.</p>
        <p>The mere fact that we can own land, paid for by our own labors is a great inspirational thing to a man.</p>
