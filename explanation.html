        <h1>The fonts and blogs are meant to represent how each character behaves and reacts to others around them. <br><br>George's font is meant to represent the smartness and conciseness of George in the book.
        <br> His blog is about his life and about him joining Lennie back in the brush.</h1>
        <h1>The boss's font is meant to represent his superiority to everyone else around him. <br> His blog is meant to show that the boss doesn't feel any sympathy for anyone and only cares about profit. His font gets red at the end from the blood he coughed up from Tuberculosis.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Lennie's font is simple like him. <br>His blog is sent after he died and met up with everyone</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Curley's wife's font is meant to represent her way with words. <br>Her blog is all her anger at Curley balled up into one paragraph</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The newspapers are meant to be printed and just a standard font. Nothing special about them</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The colors all represent something too. The brown color on the background represents the lonelieness that John Steinbeck conveys throughout the book.<br>
        The blue and green represent the brush and river and the freedom and safety that the brush area has in the book. Out there anyone can be free from labor and safe from any harm. The characters are now in the brush.</h1>
