        <h1>The fonts and blogs are meant to represent how each character behaves and reacts to others around them. <br><br>George's font is meant to represent the smartness and conciseness of George in the book.
        <br> His blog is about his life and about him joining Lennie back in the brush.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Candy's blog is about how grateful he is, which is shown in the book, his only regret though is not putting his own dog down.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Carlson's blog is showing that you reap what you sow.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Crook's post is about his life and how he realizes that the American Dream, though tough to get to is a great thing. His is the nicest font of the workers because he is the only one that has been reading and presumably learning from the books.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>In the book, Slim is a good person. His list is just a list of morals that he would follow and enforce.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Curley's recipe is just ironic because he is this small guy who likes fighting and the fruit crumble is this comfort food for him.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The boss's font is meant to represent his superiority to everyone else around him. <br> His blog is meant to show that the boss doesn't feel any sympathy for anyone and only cares about profit. His font gets red at the end from the blood he coughed up from Tuberculosis.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Lennie's font is simple like him. <br>His blog is sent after he died and met up with everyone</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>Curley's wife's font is meant to represent her way with words. <br>Her blog is all her anger at Curley balled up into one paragraph</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The newspapers are meant to be printed and just a standard font. Nothing special about them</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The colors all represent something too. The light brown-beige color on the background represents the desert and loneliness that it brings with it.<br>
        The blue and green represent the brush and river and the freedom and safety that the brush area has in the book. Out there anyone can be free from labor and safe from any harm. The characters are now in the brush.</h1>
        <br>
        <h1>The game on the top navigation panel is just a basic text game that allows you to enter a few actions and a few targets for those actions. Have fun. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. So when the game heckles you, it was meant to do that. It might be rude, that is because I was bored when making it.</h1>

        <h1>The raw code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/MooseCoding/Project">here</a> every blog is its own indivdual page. Feel free to look around at the code.</h1>
