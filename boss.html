          <p>I shoulda known those awful guys that skipped the morning shift were trouble. Murray and Readys shoulda gave them a good bus and not one that dropped them off 10 miles away.</p>
          <p>If only they never showed up on this ranch. Curley's wife is dead, a worker is dead, an' Curley is crippled now too. </p>
          <p>Thank god that Slim is still around. If he weren't here, I don't know what I'd do.</p>
