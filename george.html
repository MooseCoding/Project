          <h1>George Milton's Blog Post</h1>
          <h2>My life before Lennie</h2>
          <p>My life was decent before I met him. I was like I am now. I wandered from ranch to ranch the moment I turned old enough. My pa and ma threw me onto the streets in the 20s. It was a marvelous time.</p>
          <p>I made enough money for a monthly expense at where I wanted. Bars, resturaunts, hotels, and other fun places. I always had $10 saved for an emergency</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2>My life during Lennie</h2>
          <p>After meeting Lennie's Aunt Clara when I was between 14-20, I developed a liking to him. I started taking this strong young kid to work with me. His aunt was extermely kind to me for this.</p>
          <p>A few years pass and Aunt Clara is in the ground. Knowing that Lennie would probably get himself kill'd, I started over again with him.</p>
          <p>We go around the ranches like all the other workers do. I spent my money getting someone to watch him and going off on my own.</p>
          <p>Eventually we get to a ranch in Weed. Lennie grabs this girl's dress and she screams that she is being jumped. We barely managed to escape the dogs and the crazy "sheriffs" with guns.</p>
          <p>We got out of there and made it to a Murray and Ready's.</p>
          <p>Got assigned to a ranch in Soledad. And well you know how things went from there. I was so close to taking myself with the giant, but I couldn't bring myself to it.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h2>My life after Lennie</h2>
          <p>Me, Candy, and Crooks bought ourselves a purty property. I took care of the labor and the other two took care of the gardening, cooking and cleaning.</p>
          <p>Candy died in '39. He was out tilling the garden when he dropped to the ground. I looked in his pocket and there was a patch of fur that looked like it was 20 years old.</p>
          <p>Crooks was cooking, about 3 years after Candy's death. I heard a crack and a scream of pain. I dropped the alfalfa and ran towards him. Crooks' back had snapped it looked like. The pan of sausage and oil spilled on his face.</p>
          <p>I held his head up as he died.</p>
          <p>As the lone survivor of the Soledad Rebels, I had to keep the ranch dream going.</p>
          <p>I worked up enough to buy that Soledad ranch. I became the new boss. I hired migrants and gave them a place to make money. Over time, I my health worsend. I walk to the brush where I shot Lennie</p>
          <p>I grab my trusty luger and fire a shot up in the sky for Lennie. All of the sudden there he is with a massive rabbit. I slowly approach him and he welcomes me home.</p>
